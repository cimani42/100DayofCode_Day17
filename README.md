Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Using 100 Days of code course provided on Udemy, I have learned OOP creating a simple quiz game across multiple python file.

Creating the Quiz game I found how to create the simplicity of code. Further highlighting OOP as few lines need to be change in order to utilise a differnet data source. 
Understaning when and how to refer to 'self' is a new concept, so understanding the workflow logic, and criteria returned when testing helps write out the methods and attibutes needed.

Using the base of code provided, I should be able to recreate the data source pulling information from : https://opentdb.com/
  I could also change the relevant 'key':'value' pairs in the source code.
